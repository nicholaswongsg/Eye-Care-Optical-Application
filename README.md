# Eye-Care-Optical-Application
# Purpose
Eye Care Optical would like to have a user-friendly interface program that would allow the front desk staff to reserve an optician for eye check-up, keep track of an optician break time and to generate a sales receipt. 
Customers will be calling or walking-in each day asking for eye check-up reservations. They might also ask for the optician’s background information before continuing his or her booking with Eye Care Optical. The program will enable the service counter to check which optician is available during a specific time slot to serve its customers. Customers’ details like name, gender, date of birth, IC number, mobile phone, and email address will be entered during the reservation.

In addition, the program should also be able to take spectacle order and miscellaneous items. On top of that, the program allow comparison of up to 3 different spectacle design types to be shown to user. This will enable user to make a more informed decision.

# Algorithms
1.	Data validation for patient’s information.
2.	Booking of optician time slot will be reset to available when program is started for the day and able to indicate break slot.
3.	Colour coding for optician time slots
4.	Clear information in textbox, listbox, combobox.
5.	Print and generate a full receipt.
6.	Computations of spectacle cost, miscellaneous items cost, discount given and total due. 

# Notes
1)	Reservations are taken during the day. There are only 3 optician available in Eye Care Optician. The program should be able to cater to more additional rooms in the near future.

2)	The program should allow the user to select their preferred optician and enter values for the customer’s name, mobile phone, and home address.  The program should display that information after the reservation is made to help with easy contacting of customers.

3)	The program should provide some sort of visual representation of the spectacles as well as the ability to compare with different spectacle design type.

4)	A 10% discount on the total sales will be given to the members who can produce their card upfront.

5)	The application should also be able to generate confirmation details.
